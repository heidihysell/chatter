The is an experimental version of a simple text to speech library for Processing.

It requires the FreeTTS software and is based on the HelloWorld demo program from
FreeTTS.

FreeTTS is available at http://freetts.sourceforge.net/docs/index.php

To install, copy the simpleSpeech folder into the libraries folder of Processing.

More to come. Enjoy.
